# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Stakeholders
During the brainstorming phrase, we interviewed two different types of stakeholders: college students and gamers

### College Students
1. Course Evluation / Sharing Platform:
   1. **End user 1:**
      - **The Stakeholder / Problem**: the end user is a college freshmen studying in Beijing, China. When the end user chooses courses each semester, sometimes there are only a few information sources available for reference online. Usually, the only information source is from those who’ve already taken that course in the past semesters
  
      - **The Goal:** The end user want software that can provide students at different universities with their college’s recommended courses. They hope that this platform can centrally display past students' evaluations of a specific course, and this platform can also recommend suitable courses according to majors
    2. **End user 2:**
       - **The stakeholder / Problem:** the end user is a sophomore at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. To fulfill their gen-ed requirements, they need to complete at least two humanities courses. But it is often difficult for the target user to determine whether a certain course meets their graduation requirements (especially for humanities courses). For example, some courses may "sound like" a humanity course, but actually are not.

        - **The Goal:**  Like the previous goal, the user wants a college-specific platform that can suggest suitable courses based on their majors, such as “popular gen-ed courses taken by your classmates”
2.  A mobile school card
    - **The Stakeholder / Problem:** The target user is a sophomore studying in East China University of Political Science and Law.  At the target user’s university, their school card for entering buildings and cards for dining halls are different. Besides, they need to present a “Covid pass” when entering buildings, which is installed in a mobile app. 

    - **The Goal:**  The end user wants software that can integrate everything into a single application. Moreover, they want this application to be more like a “terminal” and more multifunctional, such as also being able to book a seat, access course materials, etc.

3.  Indoor navigation software
    - **The Stakeholder / Problem:** The target user is a commuter student at Boston College. Since his rent expires every six months, he often moves to new places. Although Google Map can navigate him to most places, he still gets lost indoors often as those software do not provide indoor navigation
      - The End user 1 shares a similar problem, but their problem is on-campus navigation (since their campus are closed campus and most navigation software does not provide navigation for their campus). 


    - **The Goal:**  The target user wants a mobile indoor navigation software that can take them to popular public places. He hopes that the software will also provide information about real-time events or future activities at that venue, as well as other users' comments on the internal areas of the that venue.
