## Stakeholders

### College Commuter Students who are either living in apartment or searching for apartments / roommates 

1.  Indoor navigation software
    - **End User 1 / Problem:** The target user (Shawn Hsu) is a commuter student at Boston College. Since his rent expires every six months, he often moves to new places. Although Google Map can navigate him to most places, he still gets lost indoors often as those software do not provide indoor navigation
    - **The Goal:**  The target user wants a mobile indoor navigation software that can take them to popular public places. He hopes that the software will also provide information about real-time events or future activities at that venue, as well as other users' comments on the internal areas of the that venue.
  
2.  Rental/flat sharing/sublettling platform
    - **End user 2 / Problem:**
        - **The stakeholder / Problem:** the end user is an international student who is struggling to find a suitable flatmate. He is a master's student looking for a flatmate under certain budget and some living preferences.

        - **The Goal:** The user wants a self-sufficient platform where he can find other people who are searching for flatmates. Instead of having to post in reddit or facebook, the user wants a specific app where he can update all his living preferences and budget and get/find a good match for him.
  
3. Apartment sublease software
     - **End User 3:** The target user is an international student of NYU.
     - **The Problem:** Since his apartment contract is one year, he needs to sublet the apartment to avoid losses when he returns to China. He can only release sublease information through apartment intermediaries and social media, which leads to that he needs to pay a lot of intermediary fees to the intermediary, or he needs to wait for people who see social media to contact him.

   - **The Goal:** Target users want a software for international students to rent apartments and sublet apartment.


4. Used furniture resale software
   - **End User 4:** The target user is an international student of NYU.

   - **The Problems:** He moves apartment once a year, and there is no furniture in the newly moved apartment, so he needs to buy new or second-hand furniture. He has to add a lot of group chats on social media because there are many international students selling used furniture in group chats.

   - **The Goal:** Target users want a software for international students to buy or sell second-hand furniture. He hopes that the software will also provide any second-hand items for sale other than furniture.

5.  Study away student guide
    - **End user 5 / Problem:**
        - **The stakeholder / Problem:** the end user is a study away student from NYU Abu Dhabi who's currently in New York for the study away semester and is willing to meet people from his country Gambia. It is difficult for him to connect to any students who are also from Gambia and are studying in NYU, NY.

        - **The Goal:** The user wants an app or a web based platform that can help study away students connect to other people, mainly from their countries of orign or where they have lived most of their lives.

## Product Vision Statement
Our program is dedicated to providing an integrated solution to the major challenges faced by most college students who need to rent apartments by integrating peer-to-peer renting process, custom roommate matching, and second-hand furniture selling/purchasing

## User Requirements
1. As a college student who has already rent an apartment, I want the system to be able to take my personal routine, habits, and preferences into account so that I can live with people who share similar habits, foods, daily routine, majors, etc. to avoid conflicts.
2. As a college student who has already rent an apartment, I want to have the ability to choose my roommates by myself, so that I can have less uncertainty on my future roommate's habits and preferences
3. As a college student who has already rent an apartment, I want to be able to communicate with my future roommates before we officially confirm, so that I can gain more insight into my roommate's personal preferences to determine if they are really suitable for living with me for the next couple of years.
4. As a college student who has already rented an apartment, I want to be able to view a list of all available second-hand furniture so that I can purchase low-price furniture for my new apartment.
5. As a college graduating student who is leaving the apartment, I want to be able to sell my old furniture and find a buyer for the furniture.
6. As a transfer college student who doesn't know the area very well, I want to be able to be matched with a Roommate that fits my preferences and living habits.
7. As a college Freshman, I don't know anyone going to my school, so I want a safe, reliable platform that shows available apartments and potential roommates in the area.
8. As a graduating college student moving back home, I want to be able to sell my furniture to other college students in a reliable and streamlined way, not through Facebook Marketplace.
9. As a college student who needs to find roommates for my apartment or who needs to find an existing apartment with roommates, I want to be able to advertise my personal information and perference so that my future roommates who share similar perferences will be able to contact with me.
