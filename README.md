# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Stakeholders
During the brainstorming phrase, we interviewed two different types of stakeholders: college students and gamers

### College Students
1. Course Evluation / Sharing Platform:
   1. **End user 1:**
      - **The Stakeholder / Problem**: the end user is a college freshmen studying in Beijing, China. When the end user chooses courses each semester, sometimes there are only a few information sources available for reference online. Usually, the only information source is from those who’ve already taken that course in the past semesters
  
      - **The Goal:** The end user want software that can provide students at different universities with their college’s recommended courses. They hope that this platform can centrally display past students' evaluations of a specific course, and this platform can also recommend suitable courses according to majors
    2. **End user 2:**
       - **The stakeholder / Problem:** the end user is a sophomore at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. To fulfill their gen-ed requirements, they need to complete at least two humanities courses. But it is often difficult for the target user to determine whether a certain course meets their graduation requirements (especially for humanities courses). For example, some courses may "sound like" a humanity course, but actually are not.

        - **The Goal:**  Like the previous goal, the user wants a college-specific platform that can suggest suitable courses based on their majors, such as “popular gen-ed courses taken by your classmates”
2.  A mobile school card
    - **End User 3 / Problem:** The target user is a sophomore studying in East China University of Political Science and Law.  At the target user’s university, their school card for entering buildings and cards for dining halls are different. Besides, they need to present a “Covid pass” when entering buildings, which is installed in a mobile app. 

    - **The Goal:**  The end user wants software that can integrate everything into a single application. Moreover, they want this application to be more like a “terminal” and more multifunctional, such as also being able to book a seat, access course materials, etc.

3.  Indoor navigation software
    - **End User 4 / Problem:** The target user is a commuter student at Boston College. Since his rent expires every six months, he often moves to new places. Although Google Map can navigate him to most places, he still gets lost indoors often as those software do not provide indoor navigation
      - The End user 1 shares a similar problem, but their problem is on-campus navigation (since their campus are closed campus and most navigation software does not provide navigation for their campus). 
    - **The Goal:**  The target user wants a mobile indoor navigation software that can take them to popular public places. He hopes that the software will also provide information about real-time events or future activities at that venue, as well as other users' comments on the internal areas of the that venue.

### Gamers
1. Mobile cloud gaming
     - **End User 5 / Problem:** The target user’s gaming device does not have enough performance to play the games they want. And although there are cloud gaming services, most of them are targeted at computer users. However, the target user is too busy in their daily life to have blocks of hours to play computer games
     - **The Goal:**  The target user want to use cloud game services to experience computer games on mobile platforms in their spare time. Meanwhile, this service is not just a simple "game launcher", but it should also be used as a platform for cloud game purchases
  
2. Game Social Group Platform (provided by the same person above)
     - **End User 5 / Problem:** The target user also plays a lot of niche mobile games. Therefore, it is usually difficult for her to find a game social circle for a specific game, let alone find some long-term online game playmates. Although most gaming social groups use software such as Discord as a platform, finding the corresponding group link on the Internet is itself a difficult task.
     - **The Goal:** The target user wants a platform that brings together the social groups of different gamers. She wants players to create and manage their game's social circle. In addition, she also hopes that the platform can provide more niche game recommendations for players like her.
  
3. Mobile Game Recommendation Platform
   - **End User 6:** The target end user is a student studying Game Design at NYU Game Center.
   - **The Problems:**
     1. The target user is a game enthusiast who has played over a hundred computer games, but he is now in a "game shortage".
     2. At the same time, the target user is also struggling to find a convenient game recommendation platform -- because most game stores and recommendation platforms (such as Steam) are currently unfriendly to mobile users, so they have to use computers to find games.
   - **The Goals:**
      1.  The target user wants to have a game recommendation software for mobile platforms; this software can be linked with their game library platform and recommend games based on their preferences in the game library. 
      2.  The target user also wants the software to become a social circle for gamers, that is, it will use the reviews and preferences from real players to recommend games instead of from game publishers. At the same time, they hope that the user experience of the software can be user-friendly to those who use their fragmented time to find games.
